                          The continuity of the economic and mone- tary crisis in Indonesia had impacted its people socially, culturally and even moral- ly. The crisis had brought down the economic growth and degrading the welfare of the people nationwide.

                        <p>
                          The underpaid working class family had to face the increasing difficulties in sustain- ing the nutritional needs and the educa- tional cost for their children. This condi- tion is worsened by the fact that many multinational companies collapsed during this time of crisis, resulting in an uncon- trollable growth of unemployment.

                          In the slum areas throughout Indonesia, the state of health and growth condition of the children and toddlers are frightening. The increase of malnutrition and the uprising of many contagious diseases and pestilences have come to an alarming state.

                          To make matters worse, series of natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunami and forest-fires continuously hit various parts of Indonesia, paralyzing the economy and creating desperation and the lost of hope for the people of Indonesia.

                          Watching and observing what happened to the people in this country have moved our hearts to form a foundation that can hopefully help them anyway we can. Therefore, we are very grateful to our compassionate God Almighty for letting us form this foundation, which enable us and other organizations to collabo-
                          rate in taking action to help and to save the underprivileged people and victims of natural disasters. Based on this commitment, we have established our motto “To reach out to those who are in needs... one by one with love and compassion”.

                        <p>
                          We are hoping with the presence of ReachOut Foundation together with Yayasan SoeryaDharma Sejahtera, we all can go hand in hand bringing the people of our nation to the better because together we can provide hope to the hopeless, changing the world one step at a time. Let us all love not just in words, but also in action and truth. God be with us in all our endeavors!
